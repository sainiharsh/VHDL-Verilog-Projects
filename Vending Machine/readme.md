# Final State Machine (FSM) - Vending Machine using VHDL

*Vending Machine that sells soda cans that costs a 2$ each.
Moreover we have only 3 types of coins: 1$, 2$ and 5$.*

Objective: To design a state machine that determines when to dispense a can, how to return the change.

Also, we can assume that only one action could be made in every “clock cycle” or state
RULES:
first give back the change then dispense the can*
